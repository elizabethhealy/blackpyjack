Play multiplayer blackjack in the command line complete with a bot that executes basic strategy. Players have the option to hit, stand, or double down in their attempt to get closer to 21 than the dealer. The dealer stands at 17 and blackjacks pay 3:2. The default table minimum is $5 and the default table maximum is $100. Each player starts out with $100 in chips.
